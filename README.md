## Game Ideas

- game is a roguelike platformer
- main mechanic is a switching mechanic
- similar to hades,  dungeon game levels will be in different tiers (think tartatus, asphodel, etc.)
- as you progress further through the roguelike map, you unlock different characters along the way
- you start with 2 switch slots
- more you go, more characters you get
- different characters can unlock different parts of the map
- enemy switching
- makes for very interesting gameplay, can switch different characters for different enemy switch combinations
- max 3 switch slots maybe
